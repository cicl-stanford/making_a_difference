I assigned blame to the people who caused the loss of the game and not just if they failed to meet the criteria because in some cases this did not matter to the final result.

If the player had to score 20 for the team to win; then they played an entirely crucial role in the task. If they shared the responsibility for achieving 20 clicks with another player; they played a 50% crucial role.I assigned full blame to players who were required to achieve the full 20 clicks; because even if the rest of the players had achieved it; the team would not have won due to that players' failure. I assigned partial blame to players who shared the responsibility with another; and no blame to those who achieved the 20 clicks.I assessed criticality in the 3rd stage in a similar way.

I also assessed their criticality depending on their position in the team; for example; if two players where in the position where one of them should reach the challenge then the criticality was somewhat shared. If a player HAD to meet the challenge in order for his team to win then he was more critical to the team than the others. In the second stage of the experiment I assessed the blame depending on whether they managed to meet the challenge (if they have then I didn't blame them at all); and on their position in the team; for example; if there were two players where one of them had to reach the challenge and didn't then the blame is shared amongst the two who either of them had to reach the challenge. I put more blame on players who HAD to meet the challenge. Finally; I assessed the criticality in the third stage according to their performance in the practise trials. ;;;;;;;;;;;

If the condition was that one out of all had to meet the criterion; the criticality depends on how good the player had been at meeting the criterion (i.e. the better the player; the more critical). If the condition was that the first and either one out of the second or third player had to meet the criterion; the first player is very critical; whilst the criticality of the second and third depended on their presupposed ability.Blame would be dependent on whether one achieved the criterion; regardless of their presupposed ability.When the players did the task one after the other; the second player would be more critical; since that player would directly affect the outcome in the case where the first player did not meet the criterion. In other words; the first player could have or not have met the criterion; whereas he second player MUST meet the criterion in the case where the first player did not. If both players played simultaneously; both of them are equally critical.;;;;

If all players had equal chances of winning then they are all equally critical. When it was either the 2nd or the 3rd player who had to win then the criticality i assessed was a bit lower. The most blame in the 2nd experiment went to the third or forth player if either of them lost since they are the most critical ones in order to win the challenge. Then for players one and two if both of them lost the challenge then they are equally to blame.When the two players played simoultaniously they are equally critical to win the challenge since; from what i recall the chances of winning were the same. When they played in turns the criticality was supposed to be lower for the first player but I only thought about that after i gave my estimates unfortunately:p;;;;;;;;;;;;

The blame was accounted for by the requirement to get over 20 clicks by the individual; I did not use past scores as a reference for this. The effort in the 3rd stage was based on a comparison with the partners past score and whoever had the highest score was most likely; in my mind; to give the greatest effort. In instances where one individual took part after their partner; a higher level of effort was chosen as if the partner had previously failed it would cause greater expectance and therefore effort on the part of the participant. Good experiment; very clearly structured. Only issue is that I made the screen larger at the start and then realised this makes the dot clicking excercise harder as the mouse has to move further; only a minor point and I'm not even sure if its important.;;;;;;;

The ones who did the best knew this and so tried harder.2) If they failed they were to blame; from the evidence we were given. the ones doing really well could have been bullying the others or something but we werent told so. 3) we werent told whether with the two players the one going second got to watch the first one; so that makes it hard to decide but i said they would both try the same as they didnt know who would do the best. we also werent told if they knew about each others test scores from the trial so.. again; not clear.;;;;;;;;;;

Whereas those in the middle will be more likely to be lazy as they will assume that they will do better. Those best at the task will probably try as hard if not a bit worse; as they will probably become too confident.2) Those that had the most responsibility to score the highest will be most blameworthy. In situations where the teams must get one; then if one person achieved the clicking rate and the other one didnt; the other one is less blameworthy as their result did not make a difference.3) Effort relates to achievement and so those that achieved highest; tried hardest;;;;;;;;;;

For instance; if it is required that player 1 needs to fulfilm the critereon; but only one of player 2 or 3 have to; then I would assume that player 1 would exert more effort than players 2 or 3 simply because player 1 has more sole responsibility and would therefore feel more pressure to achieve. Similarly; I used the challenge structure to assess blame. I assumed that if player one is required to fulfil the critereon then he/she would exert more effort; therefore I assumed that they would be less to blame since they must have done their best. Therefore; If players 2 and 3 failed to reach the criterion then I assumed this was because they did not exert enough effort in the task and so I said they were the most to blame. In the third stage i assumed that both players exerted the same amount of effort because they had equal pressure to acheive; although it is likely that in real life one of the players would be likely to rely on the other to achieve and not put as much effort in themselves. However this would require more information on the personalities of the participants.;;;;;;;;

This is because the success of the team depends more on him. If the player performed better at the practice trials; he would put in more effort if there was only one player required to meet the criterion for the team to win. The player put in more effort because he did better than the rest and the success of the team probably depends on him. If all players are required to meet the criterion; the one with the lowest performance on the test trials would put in more effort because he knew that it is likely that he would not meet the criterion and cause the whole team to lose.2) If the player had to meet the criterion for the team to win; he is more to blame if he fails than if only he or another player had to meet the criterion. 3) If both players played simultaneously; both would put in the same effort because they would not know how the other performed. If one player played first; he would put in less effort than the other because he knew that if he didn't perform well the other player can still help the team win. How much effect the second player put in depends on the performance of the first player. If the first player met the criterion he would not put in much effort. If not; he would put in more effort.;;;;;;;;

I also based it upon their accuracy in practice trials. So if a person was by themself in a team; so had to make the criteria; but had a lower accuracy in the trials; they would make more effort. If however they were in a team; the person with the lowest accuracy may make less effort as they will depend on someone with a higher accuracy. I assessed the blame by who had failed to meet the criteria. And that if all failed; they all had equal amounts of blame; afterall this is a team game; and not one person can take the fall. More effort would be demonstrated in the third part; as there is one person depending on you and the likelihood of passing is lower; and so you need to work harder to pass. There were too many teams to assess; i think 20 would have been fine. ;

If they didn't do well they would probably make more of an effort as they would be less likely to pass.  If they were solely responsible for passing they would work harder but if they were part of a pair or three; where only 1 had to pass they would probably make slightly less of an effort.2) Not one person would be solely responsible for the failure if more than one person failed because it's a team effort.  If a person succeeded they are not responsible or blameworthy.  If several people failed they would be blamed a bit each but the fewer the peple that failed; the more they were blameworthy.3) There are fewer people so they should make more of an effort as the odds of passing the test are lower with fewer participants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The player who performed the worst in the practise trials will put in increased effort because they will anticipate letting the team down with the effort they put into the practice trials. If a player performed much worse than the other two on the trials and it is not essential for them to meet the criteria; they will put in much less effort and leave it to the other players.The total blame is 100%. This is divided equally between the groups of people that were required to meet the criteria; then equally between people who faioed within these groups.Players will put in equal effort to eachother because they do not know eachothers current performance.We completed 4 trials of the dot game at the start when we were told there would be three...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

If they are less capable than their team members and the challenge only requires one member to reach the criterion; they will put in less effort. For case where all members' performance are taken into account; the less capable member will exert more effort than others; since they know that they might be a burden to the team. The assignment of blame depends on how crucial one is in determining if the team wins the challenge or not. The greater the contribution of one's performance to the team's performance; the more blame is assigned to the member. In the third stage; the amount of effort put in by both players will be equivalent regardless of whether they did the challenge simultaneously or one after another. ;;;;;;;;;;

The effort of the players will depend on their performance on the practice trials and on the task. If only one out of three need to succeed then the person with the lowest rate at the prsctice trials will put the lowest amoun t of effort; as he would shift the responsability to the two other players. If all three are equally good/bad in practice; and the task requires all three to succeed then the effort would be fairly equal.2. Those two guys who are required to reach 20 clicks are the most responsible for the loss if they havent reached 20 clicks3.

But I also took their average scores into account; so if someone was really good at the game then they might not have tried as hard as someone who was worse and so knew they might not win. If only one person had to win; then I assumed that the person who was the best at the game would exert the most effort and try and win for their team; whilst the others would not try as hard because they know that there is a better person than them in the team who will win for them. If there were two stages to the challege; then I assumed that the first player would exert the most effort in order to pass the first stage and not let their team members down; because they would feel guilty that they didn't give the others a chance to win the challenge.2) If the players who were required to pass in order for the team to win did not; then I assigned the blame mostly to them because they didn't even give the other team members a chance to try and win. 3) As there are only two people in this challange I thought that they would exert the same amount of effort because they feel equally to blame if their team loses. Also; they may feel competitive even though it's a team game; because there are only two of them; and so they would try harder to win because of this.;;;;;

If they fail more often; they should put more effort into the task. Also; if their score was taken into account seperately; they should put more effort into it.2)blame: According to the scores; if they failed their score was takemn into account seperately. However; the more people failed; the less each individual player was to blame.3)how much effort: When the players played simultaneously; they should put the same amount of effort in. However; when one player played after another; he should put more effort if the first player failed and less if the first one already completred the challenge.;;;;;;
